          When Vonita opened the doors of the Center that morning, she had no
          idea that it would be for the last time. Wren has missed school to
          come to the Center, the sole surviving women's reproductive health
          clinic in the state, chaperoned by her aunt, Bex. Olive told Peg she
          was just coming for a check-up. Janine is undercover, a pro-life
          protester disguised as a patient. Joy needs to terminate her
          pregnancy. Louie is there to perform a service for these women, not in
          spite of his faith, but because of it. When a desperate and distraught
          gunman bursts into the Center, opening fire and taking everyone
          hostage, Hugh McElroy is the police negotiator called to the scene. He
          has no idea that his fifteen-year-old daughter is inside. Told in a
          daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward
          through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way
          back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the
          same place on this fateful day. Jodi Picoult - one of the most
          fearless writers of our time - tackles a complicated issue in this
          gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant
          women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to
          be a good parent? A Spark of Light will inspire debate, conversation
          ... and, hopefully, understanding.

            When your son can't look you in the eye...does that mean he's
            guilty? Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless
            at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though
            he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one
            subject--forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him
            in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops
            what to do. And he's usually right.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law
            enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's,
            but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the
            Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight.
            For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance
            and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his
            brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because
            of Jacob.
          </p>
          <p>
            And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: Did
            Jacob commit murder?

          Alice Metcalf was a devoted mother, loving wife and accomplished
          scientist who studied grief among elephants. Yet it's been a decade
          since she disappeared under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind
          her small daughter, husband, and the animals to which she devoted her
          life. All signs point to abandonment - or worse. Still Jenna - now
          thirteen years old and truly orphaned by a father maddened by grief -
          steadfastly refuses to believe in her mother's desertion. So she
          decides to approach the two people who might still be able to help her
          find Alice: a disgraced psychic named Serenity Jones, and Virgil
          Stanhope, the cynical detective who first investigated her mother's
          disappearance and the strange, possibly linked death of one of her
          mother's coworkers. Together these three lonely souls will discover
          truths destined to forever change their lives. Deeply moving and
          suspenseful, this Jodi Picoult novel is a radiant exploration of the
          enduring love between mothers and daughters.

          Another tour de force from Jodi Picoult, Lone Wolf examines the wild
          and lonely terrain upon which love battles reason. Edward Warren,
          twenty-four, has been living in Thailand for five years; a prodigal
          son who left his family after an irreparable fight with his father,
          Luke. Then he gets a frantic phone call: his dad lies comatose,
          gravely injured in the same accident that has also injured his younger
          sister, Cara. With her father's chances for recovery dwindling, Cara
          wants to wait for a miracle. But Edward wants to terminate life
          support and donate his father's organs. Is he motivated by altruism,
          or revenge? And to what lengths will his sister go to stop him from
          making an irrevocable decision? Lone Wolf explores the notion of
          family, and the love, protection and strength it's meant to offer. But
          what if the hope that should sustain it, is the very thing that pulls
          it apart? 'Haunting and powerful ... takes you to another place.'

          What would you do for someone you love? Would you lie? Would you
          leave? Would you kill? Jodi Picoult confronts these powerful issues in
          Mercy, which follows the path of two cousins driven to extremes by the
          power of love. Police chief of a small Massachusetts town, Cameron
          McDonald makes the toughest arrest of his life when his own cousin
          Jamie comes to him and confesses outright that he has killed his
          terminally ill wife out of mercy. A heated murder trial plunges the
          town into upheaval and drives a wedge into a contented marriage:
          Cameron, aiding the prosecution in their case against Jamie, finds
          himself suddenly at odds with his devoted wife, Allie. She is seduced
          by the idea of a man so in love with his wife that he'd grant all her
          wishes, even her wish to end her life. And when an inexplicable
          attraction leads to a shocking betrayal, Allie faces the hardest
          questions of the heart: when does love cross the line of moral
          obligation? And what does it mean to truly love another? Tightly woven
          with passion and a fast-paced plot, Mercy explores some of today's
          most highly charged emotional and ethical issues as it draws toward
          its stunning conclusion.

          'Rarely have I read such an eloquent portrayal of the family in
          crisis. Every character: real. Every situation: true. Picoult defies
          you to put this novel down once you've begun it. I do the same.' -
          Elizabeth George Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age
          thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions and
          shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia
          that has plagued her since childhood. Anna was conceived as a bone
          marrow match for Kate, a life and a role that she has never questioned
          until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she
          truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in
          terms of her sister - and so Anna makes a decision that for most would
          be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have
          perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. Told from
          multiple points of view, My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to
          be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct
          to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means
          infringing upon the rights of another? Should you follow your own
          heart, or let others lead you? What happens when emotion catches up to
          scientific advances? Jodi Picoult is the author of more than twenty
          bestselling and widely acclaimed novels. Read more about her on her

          Moving seamlessly from psychological drama to courtroom suspense,
          Plain Truth is a triumph of contemporary storytelling. Jodi Picoult
          presents a fascinating portrait of Amish life rarely witnessed by
          those outside the faith - and discovers a place where circumstances
          are not always what they seem, where love meets falsehood, and where
          relationships grow strong enough to transcend death. When Ellie
          Hathaway decides to defend an unmarried Amish woman against the charge
          of the murder of her own child, the urban-savvy defence attorney finds
          herself caught in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of
          justice are markedly different from her own. Plain Truth is the
          extraordinary story of two unforgettable women - and what happens when
          their disparate worlds collide.

          Dawn Edelstein knows everything there is to know about dying. She
          specialises in helping her clients make peace with the end of their
          lives. But as she's flying home from her latest case, she is forced to
          confront her own mortality for the first time. Instead of seeing her
          brilliant quantum physicist husband and their beloved daughter flash
          before her eyes in what she assumes are her last moments, only one
          face is shockingly clear: Wyatt Armstrong. Safely on the ground, Dawn
          now faces a desperate decision. Should she return to Boston, her
          family and the life she knows, or journey back to an Egyptian
          archaeological site she left over a decade earlier, reconnect with
          Wyatt, and finally finish her abandoned magnum opus, The Book of Two
          Ways? As the story unfolds, Dawn must confront the questions she's
          never truly answered: What does a life well-lived look like? When we
          depart this earth, what do we leave behind of ourselves? And who would
          you be if you hadn't turned out to be the person you are right now?

          Sage Singer is a young woman who has been damaged by her past. Her
          solitary night work as a baker allows her to hide from the world and
          focus her creative energies on the beautiful bread she bakes. Yet she
          finds herself striking up an unlikely friendship. Josef Weber is a
          quiet, grandfatherly man, well respected in the community; everyone's
          favourite retired teacher and Little League coach. One day he asks
          Sage for a favour: to kill him. Shocked, Sage refuses. Then Josef
          tells her that he deserves to die - and why. What do you do when evil
          lives next door? Can someone who's committed horrendous acts ever
          truly redeem themselves? Is forgiveness yours to offer if you aren't
          the person who was wronged? And most of all - if Sage even considers
          his request - would it be murder, or justice?

            In the breathtaking beauty of the Galapagos Islands, Diana will
            learn who she really is, and the person she wants to become, in
            Jodi's deeply moving novel about the resilience of the human spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana O'Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by thirty,
            done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New York City
            suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in the cutthroat
            art auction world. She's a junior appraiser at Sotheby's now, but
            her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can close a deal with a
            high-profile client. She's not engaged just yet, but she knows her
            boyfriend Finn, a surgical resident, is about to propose – days
            before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A near-death experience brings Diana abruptly back to familiar city
            surroundings, where she tries to pick up the threads of her old
            life. Has she changed or have the people around her? Diana is no
            longer prepared to be just a follower, at work or in her
            relationships. She breaks down years of a stunted relationship with
            her mother, takes the initiative in her career, and looks at Finn
            through new eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jodi Picoult's matchless ability to portray the full gamut of human
            emotions is once again on display, along with her characteristically
            meticulous research into today's burning issues.
