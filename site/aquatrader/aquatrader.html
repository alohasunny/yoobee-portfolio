        <h2>Sakura</h2>
        <p>
          Sakura goldfish is any fancy breed that sports the "matte"
          characteristic in which the majority of the scales are semitransparent
          but with a sprinkling of several metallic scales and carrying only red
          pigmentation on its otherwise pinkish-white body. In other words, a
          calico goldfish minus the black and the blue.
