      <h3>Waikato-Manukau Treaty (English)</h3>

      <p>
        HER MAJESTY VICTORIA Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
        Ireland regarding with Her Royal Favor the Native Chiefs and Tribes of
        New Zealand and anxious to protect their just Rights and Property and to
        secure to them the enjoyment of Peace and Good Order has deemed it
        necessary in consequence of the great number of Her Majesty's Subjects
        who have already settled in New Zealand and the rapid extension of
        Emigration both from Europe and Australia which is still in progress to
        constitute and appoint a functionary properly authorized to treat with
        the Aborigines of New Zealand for the recognition of Her Majesty's
        Sovereign authority over the whole or any part of those islands â€“ Her
        Majesty therefore being desirous to establish a settled form of Civil
        Government with a view to avert the evil consequences which must result
        from the absence of the necessary Laws and Institutions alike to the
        native population and to Her subjects has been graciously pleased to
        empower and to authorize me William Hobson a Captain in Her Majesty's
        Royal Navy Consul and Lieutenant-Governor of such parts of New Zealand
        as may be or hereafter shall be ceded to her Majesty to invite the
        confederated and independent Chiefs of New Zealand to concur in the
        following Articles and Conditions.
      </p>

      <h4>Article the first [Article 1]</h4>

      <p>
        The Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand and
        the separate and independent Chiefs who have not become members of the
        Confederation cede to Her Majesty the Queen of England absolutely and
        without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty which the
        said Confederation or Individual Chiefs respectively exercise or
        possess, or may be supposed to exercise or to possess over their
        respective Territories as the sole sovereigns thereof.
      </p>

      <h4>Article the second [Article 2]</h4>

      <p>
        Her Majesty the Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the Chiefs
        and Tribes of New Zealand and to the respective families and individuals
        thereof the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and
        Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may
        collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and
        desire to retain the same in their possession; but the Chiefs of the
        United Tribes and the individual Chiefs yield to Her Majesty the
        exclusive right of Preemption over such lands as the proprietors thereof
        may be disposed to alienate at such prices as may be agreed upon between
        the respective Proprietors and persons appointed by Her Majesty to treat
        with them in that behalf.
      </p>

      <h4>Article the third [Article 3]</h4>
      <p>
        In consideration thereof Her Majesty the Queen of England extends to the
        Natives of New Zealand Her royal protection and imparts to them all the
        Rights and Privileges of British Subjects.
      </p>

      <p class="signature">(signed) William Hobson, Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

      <p>
        Now therefore We the Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of
        New Zealand being assembled in Congress at Victoria in Waitangi and We
        the Separate and Independent Chiefs of New Zealand claiming authority
        over the Tribes and Territories which are specified after our respective
        names, having been made fully to understand the Provisions of the
        foregoing Treaty, accept and enter into the same in the full spirit and
        meaning thereof in witness of which we have attached our signatures or
        marks at the places and the dates respectively specified. Done at
        Waitangi this Sixth day of February in the year of Our Lord one thousand
        eight hundred and forty.
